## Description

My motivation for this project was to become comfortable working with html and css together. It was to complete the project according to the directions given to me by my bootcamp. I built this project in order to learn what was necessary code. I learned what to rename the divs appropriately in html. I was able to make items clickable on the website. I learned to get rid of redundant code in css. In the end I was able to learn how html and css work together in order to build a website.
